We serve consumers through our retail websites and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation', 'type': 'Section', 'doc_id': 'e8c794e2-1463-44ec-b76f-dcabc3c321f5', 'properties': {'score': 0.8248727917671204, 'path': 'financebenchdoc.pdf', 'page_number': 41, 'page_numbers': [41, 42]}}}, {'_index': 'sample0', '_id': '48d9d1a0-cbf7-4898-a73c-bf94f29e4377', '_score': 0.51681435, '_source': {'parent_id': '17196066-55c2-11ef-aec0-0e0308f3cbb1', 'elements': [], 'bbox': [0.027208283368278952, 0.028547578291459517, 0.9583942009420956, 0.9016218150745738], 'shingles': None, 'text_representation': '76\\nTable of Contents\\nTable of Contents\\n10.27 1999 Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan (amended and restated) (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10- O for the Quarter ended March 31, 2013).\\n10.37 Form of Indemnification Agreement between the Company and each of its Directors (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-23795) filed March 24, 1997, as amended on April 21, 1997).\\n10.4¢ Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for Officers and Employees (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year ended December 31, 2002).\\n10.5+ Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for Directors (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year ended December 31, 2002).\\n10.67 Form of Restricted Stock Agreement (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year ended December 31 2001).\\n10.77 Form of Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for Executive Officers (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-O for the Quarter ended June 30, 2017).\\n10.8 Credit Agreement, dated as of May 20, 2016, among Amazon.com, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (incorporated by reference to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-QO for the Quarter ended June 30, 2016).\\n10.9+ Independent Contractor Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2017, between Amazon Corporate LLC and William B.

We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.
