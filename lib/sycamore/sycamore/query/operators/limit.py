        - *description* is a written description of the purpose of this operation in this context
            and justification of why you chose to use it.
        - *K* is the number of rows of the data table to return.
        - *input* is a list of operation ids that this operation depends on. For this operation,
            *input* should only contain one id of an operation that returns a data table
            (len(input) == 1).
        - *id* is a uniquely assigned integer that serves as an identifier.
