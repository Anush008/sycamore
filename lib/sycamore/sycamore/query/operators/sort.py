        **Sort**: Sorts a data table based on the value of a field.
        Parameters are *description*, *descending*, *field*, *input*, and *id*.
        Returns an ordered data table.
        - *description* is a written description of the purpose of this operation in this context
            and justification of why you chose to use it.
        - *descending* is a Boolean that determines whether to sort in descending order
            (greatest value first).
        - *field* is the name of the database field to sort based on.
        - *input* is a list of operation ids that this operation depends on. For this operation,
            *input* should only contain one id of an operation that returns a data table
            (len(input) == 1).
        - *id* is a uniquely assigned integer that serves as an identifier.
