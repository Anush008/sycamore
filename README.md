# crawler

Crawler component

## Overview

### HTTP crawler

The Aryn HTTP crawler is based on [scrapy](http://scrapy.org), a framework for writing web
crawlers.  We override the crawl class to follow links within a single domain starting from a
single root and store those files locally to match with how the Aryn importer wants them.  The
crawler uses scrapy's RFC2616 caching in order to reduce the load from crawling.
